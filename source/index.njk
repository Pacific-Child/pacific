		<p>The Pacific Regional Council on Early Childhood Development (PRC4ECD), established at a ministerial roundtable in the 2019 Pacific ECD Forum held in Nadi, Fiji, is an inter-governmental and multisectoral body that provides leadership and strategic direction on policies, programmes, and investments that support the holistic development of our young children in the Pacific.</p>
		<p>The council brings together the ministries of education, finance, health, planning, internal affairs, women & children, and social welfare from fifteen Pacific Island Countries and territories: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tokelau, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.</p>
		<p>Their first formal meeting is to be held virtually on 26 & 27 November, 2020. In this meeting, the objectives are to foster even stronger political will on a whole-of-government approach to early investments, specifically in the context of COVID-19 and as the Pacific region builds back better.</p>

					<p>The Pacific Regional Council on Early Childhood Development (PRC4ECD) has chosen the baby sea turtle as its symbol, as it represents both childhood and the Pacific community as a whole. Turtles are considered sacred in many Pacific cultures, symbolizing longevity, wellness, and protection &mdash; all of which are intrinsic to the concept of early childhood development. A baby turtle, specifically, represents strength, resilience, and even hope: this tiny, vulnerable creature &mdash; swimming in a huge expanse of ocean &mdash; will grow into a majestic giant that may live for hundreds of years and swim thousands of miles.</p>
					<p>Turtles range widely across the Pacific. They are not associated with any single nation, and thus act as an inclusive symbol for the Blue Continent’s whole community. They are, finally, a symbol of the community’s complexity and potential: they live in the water, in the vast depths, always moving, swimming from one place to another like connecting threads in the vast and diverse Pacific.</p>
